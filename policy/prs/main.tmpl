{{ if mustHas "el7" $bv.Features -}}
{{ .Name }}:{{ .Branch}} needs to support RHEL7. RHEL7 support was dropped in 5.1 and then brought back in 5.2.1. This PR may not directly affect RHEL7 support but it may need testing on RHEL7 to make sure it still works. Release/upgrade-tests will perform some basic tests on supported OSes but this is no guarantee of everything being alright.

{{ if mustHas "plugin-compiler-fix-vendor" $bv.Features -}}
{{ .Name }}:{{ .Branch}} needs to be built _without_ module support and the dependencies vendored for the sake of the plugin compiler. This is implemented in release.yml. Note that the plugin compiler itself is _not_ part of the templates and is built by its own workflow, this PR is probably only about the gateway.
