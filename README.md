# Gromit

## Installation
Install from the [releases](releases) page. To keep up with releases using [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) in turbo mode, 

``` shell
zinit wait lucid from"gh-r" nocompile for \
      bpick"*Linux_x86_64.tar.gz" TykTechnologies/gromit
```

## Configuration
This is ostensibly a [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra "cobra cli") app and can be configured with a config file to save a bunch of typing. A sample `gromit.yaml` file looks like:

``` yaml
authtoken: supersekret
tablename: GromitTest
registryid: "046805072452"
repos: "tyk,tyk-analytics,tyk-pump"

cluster:
  zoneid: Z02045551IU0LZIOX4AO0
  domain: test.tyk.technology

licenser:
  bot: <license_server_url>
  dash:
    token: supersekret
    api: dashboard-trial
  mdcb:
    token: supersekret
    api: mdcb-trial?auth=supersekret
```

All parameters can also be set by environment variables with the `GROMIT_` prefix. So the environment variable for the config parameter `cluster.domain` would be `GROMIT_CLUSTER_DOMAIN`.

## Features
To various degrees of competence, gromit can,
- manage templated files that can be rendered into any repo under management
  * releng
  * gpac (github policy as code)
- manage the meta-automation for releng ([sync-automation.yml](policy/templates/sync-automation.tmpl "template"))
- fetch developer licenses for dashboard and mdcb
- generate config files from a `text/template`
- dump redis and mongo data for a classic cloud org to local disk (broken)
- restore redis and mongo data for a classic cloud org from local disk (broken)

### Policy Engine for release engineering
Policies are implemented by rendering template bundles, which are usually embedded into the binary. The rendering is mere text substitution and is agnostic to the language used in the template. It is best to use declarative or some sort of well-understood configuration language like YAML in the templates though.

#### releng
This bundle contains all of the code required to build and test all the artefacts that are created when a release is made. Releases are made by pushing a tag to github. 

#### sync
This bundle handles the meta-automation to keep the releng bundle in sync across all the release branches. 

#### gpac
This bundle implements terraform manifests that model the state of the repos under management in github. This is used to [keep track of release branches](https://tyktech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/1907228677/Release+branches) as they are created.

#### policy-dump
This bundle is purely for debug/informational purpose, and generates a policy.md markdown file in the given location with the release branches information for the given repo.

Sample policy dump generated for tyk is given below for reference:

### Usage
``` shellsession
% gromit help
It also has a grab bag of various ops automation.
Global env vars:
These vars apply to all commands
GROMIT_TABLENAME DynamoDB tablename to use for env state
GROMIT_REPOS Comma separated list of ECR repos to answer for

Usage:
  gromit [command]

Available Commands:
  cluster     Manage cluster of tyk components
  env         Mess about with the env state
  help        Help about any command
  licenser    Get a trial license and writes it to path, overwriting it
  orgs        Dump/restore org keys and mongodb
  passwd      Returns the password hash of the given plaintext
  policy      Mess with the release engineering policy
  reap        Reap envs from GROMIT_TABLENAME, using a config tree at <config root path>
  repo        Work with git repos
  serve       Run endpoint for github requests
  sow         Sow envs creating a config tree at <config root path>
  version     Print version

Flags:
  -f, --conf string       config file (default is $HOME/.config/gromit.yaml)
  -h, --help              help for gromit
  -l, --loglevel string   Log verbosity: trace, info, warn, error (default "info")

Use "gromit [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Testing
All tests in the `cmd` directory are system tests. Tests in other directories are unit tests. `make test` runs the tests and requires access to the [Engg PoC](https://046805072452/signing/aws/amazon.com/console/) AWS account.

The tests depend on:
- ECR repos
- DynamoDB table
- some other AWS stuff, see config file

This infra is provisioned in the Engg PoC account and can be found in the `devenv-euc1-test` Terraform workspace for the state in [tyk-ci/infra](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ci/tree/master/infra).

If your AWS account does not have the power to run the tests, please post in #devops.

## CD
The [Release](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/gromit/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease) action builds a new docker image.

### Chrome
It looks like Chrome doesn't trust the local ca-certificates. You can add it to the per-user nss store in `~/.pki/nssdb` as per [per the docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/cert_management.md).

``` shellsession
% apt install libnss3-tools
% certutil -d .pki/nssdb -A -t "C,," -n gromit -i /usr/share/ca-certificates/gromit/rootca.crt
```

Import your client certificates with after converting it to PKCS#12/PFX form,

``` shellsession
% openssl pkcs12 -export -out gclient.p12 -inkey ~gromit/testdata/gromit/ccerts/key.pem -in ~gromit/testdata/gromit/ccerts/cert.pem -certfile ~ci/certs/rootca/rootca.pem 
% pk12util -d sql:.pki/nssdb -i gclient.p12 -n gromitclient
```

### curl

``` shellsession
% curl -v --key ~gromit/testdata/gromit/ccerts/key.pem --cert ~gromit/testdata/gromit/ccerts/cert.pem https://127.0.0.1/healthcheck
