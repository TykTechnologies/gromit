policy:
  # `policy` is the root object for the policy and bundle commands. Any
  # parent policy options provided here can be overridden by repo
  # specific/ branch specific options.
  # features act as flags whose presence/absence can be used to
  # render a common set of features across branch(es)
  # For eg: there are some branches that support el/7, and some that doesn't - to
  # render el/7 support on these branches, add  `el7` as a feature of these
  # branches and write the template conditions accordingly to render the templates
  # with el7 support based on the presence of this flag
